</script>

A lot has happened since my last post about this site. I spent a lot of time
making this place pretty and neat, and not enough time writing about my
discoveries. So without further ado, here is my guide to Svelte Kit + MDSvex.

A few weeks ago, I replaced the markdown-based blog setup that was [previously
written about](/blog/portfolio-site-2021). It was due for a make-over with the
upgrade from Sapper to Svelte Kit. Some of the dependencies was used to make
that setup work, like [the code highlighter](https://prismjs.com/), is poorly
modularized. It exists in the global scope, making it a bad fit for Svelte Kit
which relies heavily on ESM's import/export for tree shaking and other goodies.

I was excited to explore how I could solve things better. Through
experimentation and a lot of help from the [Svelte Discord
server](https://svelte.dev/chat), I think I've settled on something pretty darn
good.

## Enter MDSveX

MDSveX is Svelte in Markdown. It allows you to write Markdown files that contain
Svelte components. It's also a lot more! It is an extensible markdown parser --
and I've found it integrates really nicely with Svelte Kit despite not even
being designed for it.

MDSveX comes with the stuff you need from a markdown parser:

- A code highlighter automatically highlights code blocks, supporting most
  languages out of the box
- It hooks into the [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and
  [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) ecosystems, which let you add
  custom parsing logic
- Front-matter is automatically parsed as metadata, letting you pull it out by
  importing the component (more on this later)

A typical MDSveX component is defined with the `.svx` extension. It primarily
contains Markdown, but it also allows all the Svelte syntax like `<script>`
blocks and `{curly_braces}`.

```markdown
---
title: My cool counter
date: 2021-05-20
summary: A cool counter I made
---

<script>
  import Count from "./Count.svelte"
</script>

# {title}

Ever want to increment a number? Now you can!

<Counter />
```

> **My cool counter**
>
> Ever want to increment a number? Now you can!
>
> <Counter />

Pretty neat, right? Note how the `{title}` was referenced in the markup. The
data defined in the front matter can also be accessed as variables in the
component.

Because Svelte Kit renders components in `src/routes` as pages, this file would
be rendered as a page as well. For example, if you have a file at
`src/routes/blog/my-cool-counter.svx` this would result as a page at
`/blog/my-cool-counter`.

## Configuration and plugins

For Svelte Kit, MDSveX plugs in as a preprocessor. MDSveX then transforms all
`.svx` files to regular components.

Here's a minimal example:

```javascript
/* svelte.config.js */

import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex"
import sveltePreprocess from "svelte-preprocess"

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
	// Pick up both .svelte and .svx files
	extensions: [".svelte", ".svx"],

	// Run mdsvex transformations, then svelte-preprocess
	preprocess: [mdsvex(), sveltePreprocess()]
}
```

You can further enhance your output by adding [remark and rehype
plugins](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/docs#remarkplugins--rehypeplugins) to modify
the AST before outputting as HTML. For example, here's a sample of the
processing on this blog:

```javascript
/* svelte.config.js */

import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex"
import abbr from "remark-abbr"
import urls from "rehype-urls"
import slug from "rehype-slug"
import autoLinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings"
import addClasses from "rehype-add-classes"

function processUrl(url, node) {
	if (node.tagName === "a") {
		node.properties.class = "text-link"

		if (!url.href.startsWith("/")) {
			// Open external links in new tab
			node.properties.target = "_blank"
			// Fix a security concern with offsite links
			// See: https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/
			node.properties.rel = "noopener"
		}
	}
}

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
	extensions: [".svelte", ".svx"],

	preprocess: mdsvex({
		plugins: {
			remarkPlugins: [abbr], // adds support for footnote-like abbreviations
			rehypePlugins: [
				figure, // convert images into <figure> elements
				[urls, processUrl], // adds rel and target to <a> elements
				slug, // adds slug to <h1>-<h6> elements
				[autoLinkHeadings, { behavior: "wrap" }], // adds a <a> around slugged <h1>-<h6> elements
				[addClasses, { "ul,ol": "list" }] // add classes to these elements
			]
		}
	})
}
```

## Layouts

Just like how `__layout.svelte` wraps around Svelte Kit pages, MDSveX has a way
to define layouts for `.svx` files. These are normal Svelte components
with a `<slot>`. The slot being where the article goes.

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/blog/layout.svelte -->
<script>
	// These props get filled in from the page's front matter
	export let title
	export let coverImageUrl
</script>

<svelte:head>
	<title>{title}</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content={title} />
	<meta property="og:image" content={coverImageUrl} />
</svelte:head>

<article>
	<h1>{title}</h1>
	<slot />
	<a href="/blog">Back to blog index</a>
</article>
```

```javascript
/* svelte.config.js */

import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex"

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
	extensions: [".svelte", ".svx"],

	preprocess: mdsvex({
		// This is where the layouts are defined
		layout: {
			blog: "./src/routes/blog/layout.svelte",
			projects: "./src/routes/projects/layout.svelte"
		}
	})
}
```

MDSveX will try to guess which layout should be used based on the filename. If
you have a a blog post at `src/routes/blog/my-post.svx`, this would use the
`blog` layout because the string `blog` exists in the filename.

You can also force the layout by defining it in the front matter:

```markdown
---
layout: article
title: Article layout example
coverImageUrl: https://example.com/path/to/my/image.png
---

I will always use the `article` layout!
```

Despite having a lot in common, MDSveX layouts currently work as a separate
system from Svelte Kit's own `__layout.svelte`. As I understand this is due to
technical limitation. It would be cool if MDSveX and Svelte Kit's layouts could
be unified in the future. 🐧

## Rendering a list of blog posts

In order for users to find your blog post, we can provide a list of the posts on
our site. By utilizing Vite's
[`import.meta.glob`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import), we can
automatically grab all the `.svx` files in the current directory. These files
can be imported as modules, and we can collect metadata from them. Finally, we
serve the payload as a [Svelte Kit
endpoint](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#routing-endpoints).

```js
/* src/routes/blog/posts.json.js */

import pMap from "p-map"
import { basename } from "path"

export async function get() {
	// Import all .svx files in the directory
	const modules = import.meta.glob("./*.svx")

	// Run a map over each module

	// Check out the docs for p-map if this looks confusing, it's  basically
	// Array.map(...) but for promises
	const posts = await pMap(
		Object.entries(modules),
		async function ([filename, module]) {
			// Import the component. The metadata here is added by MDSveX and mirrors
			// the front matter.
			const { metadata } = await module()

			return {
				title: metadata.title,
				date: new Date(metadata.date),
				summary: metadata.summary,
				slug: basename(filename, ".svx") // Generate a slug we can link to
			}
		}
	)

	// Sort posts by descending date
	posts.sort((a, b) => (a.date > b.date ? -1 : 1))

	return {
		body: { posts }
	}
}
```

On requesting `GET /blog/posts.json` it would return this JSON:

```json
{
	"posts": [
		{
			"title": "So I tried out MDSveX on Svelte Kit",
			"date": "2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z",
			"summary": "And not too surprisingly I really like it",
			"slug": "svelte-kit-mdsvex"
		},
		{
			"title": "Crafting the portfolio site",
			"date": "2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z",
			"summary": "Updated portfolio website for 2021. Built with Sapper and Svelte.",
			"slug": "portfolio-site-2021"
		},
		{
			"title": "Reimagining Type Kana",
			"date": "2020-08-02T00:00:00.000Z",
			"summary": "A quiz app to help you learn hiragana and katakana, the Japanese syllabaries.",
			"slug": "type-kana"
		}
	]
}
```

The data could then be fetched in a [loading
function](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#loading), and provided to a page to render
this as a list of blog posts.

## Pain points

### TypeScript

If you're familiar working with TypeScript in Svelte, you'll unfortunately have
to skip it when it comes to the MDSveX parts of your application. MDSveX does
not play nice with svelte-preprocess, and will break your whole app if it runs
into process `<script lang="ts">`. This is tracked in [issue
#116](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX/issues/116).

### Loading

[`load`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#loading) can be really useful for fetching
additional content before component render time. Sometimes, there's also a case
for wanting to do this in a MDSveX layout, say if you want to render a list of
related posts. Unfortunately, load is only supported in components that define a
page. This means that if you want to fetch some data for _each_ blog post you'd
have to do something like this inside each `.svx` file that uses the layout:

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/blog/my-post.svx -->
<script context="module">
	import { load } from "./_load"
	export { load }
</script>
```

```javascript
/* src/routes/blog/_load.ts */
export async function load({ fetch, page }) {
	// /related.json is an endpoint that returns all related blog posts/projects
	const url = page.path + "/related.json"
	const res = await fetch(url)

	if (res.ok) {
		const { projects } = await res.json()

		return {
			props: {
				relatedProjects: projects
			}
		}
	} else {
		return {
			status: res.status,
			error: new Error("Failed to fetch " + url)
		}
	}
}
```

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/blog/_layout.svelte -->
<script>
	export let relatedPosts
</script>

<slot />

{#each relatedPosts as post}
	<li>
		<a href={"/blog/" + post.slug} class="text-link">
			{post.title}
		</a>
		<span class="quiet">- {friendlyDate(post.date, true)}</span>
	</li>
{/each}
```

All of that is kind of roundabout, but it achieves the desired effect.

## That's a wrap

MDSveX helps bridge the gap between a simple personal blog and full blown CMS
powered website. It makes writing new blog posts easy without having to add a
complex blog writing system to your application. For my use case it's perfect!

The source code for the site is available on GitHub, linked below. Check it out

That's all for now!
